# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability in OpenEMR, there are two options for reporting  the vulnerability to the OpenEMR Security Team.
  - **Option 1**: Report the vulnerability via a "Security Report" github issue on OpenEMR's github repository. The "Security Report" issue will be private and only visible to the OpenEMR Security Team.
  - **Option 2**: Report the vulnerability by sending an email to the OpenEMR Security Team email at security@open-emr.org . If possible, please encrypt your email via PGP with this [public key](https://www.open-emr.org/files/openemr-security-pgp-key.asc).
